## Bio

I did my Master in Forestry Sciences and Forest Ecology with a study focus on Ecosystem Modelling.
My main research workflow includes agent-based modelling (mainly NetLogo), data analysis (mainly R), as well as data visualization and communication. I am also experienced in QGIS, SAS, HTML and Java.

If you are interested in my current reasearch projects, please check out the [projects section](/projects/).
